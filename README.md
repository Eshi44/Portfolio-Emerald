# Emerald Sea Hamel-Iervolino Portfolio ðŸ’Ž A Node, Express, React App

Hi! I'm Emerald, a Full-Stack Developer based in the Atlanta Area. I am proficient in a variety of programming languages, which I use to create intuitive user designs. I excel at communication, analysis, and organization, and I am always eager to learn new skills.

Shortly before graduating with a B.S. in Psychology, I enrolled in Georgia Techâ€™s intensive 12-week bootcamp, with a focus on JavaScript, MERN Stack, and responsive web design.
